# Portfolio Site Project #
This is my first project that make *responsive single-page website*. This portfolio will display differently in different screen size. When opening this site in mobile, the heading will stretch out to cover full screen, and the displayed images will have small file sizes. When the screen size become larger, the layout will change, and the website will load larger images. This will save the bandwidth and improve user experience.

## Dependency ##
